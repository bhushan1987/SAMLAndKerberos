BeanShell Issues-
- If default constructor is defined explicitly, then it considers it as a normal method and expects return type - which ends up in error.
- Generics are not supported by BeanShell. https://github.com/beanshell/beanshell/issues/22
- Latest development is not on Apache license. https://github.com/pejobo/beanshell2
